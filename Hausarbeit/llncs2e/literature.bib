             Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 (HTTP/2)

Abstract

   This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics
   of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), referred to as HTTP
   version 2 (HTTP/2).  HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network
   resources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header
   field compression and allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the
   same connection.  It also introduces unsolicited push of
   representations from servers to clients.

   This specification is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the
   HTTP/1.1 message syntax.  HTTP’s existing semantics remain unchanged.

Abstract
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia
information systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks beyond its use for
hypertext, such as name servers and distributed object management systems, through extension of its request
methods, error codes and headers [47]. A feature of HTTP is the typing and negotiation of data representation,
allowing systems to be built independently of the data being transferred.

HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. This specification defines
the protocol referred to as “HTTP/1.1”, and is an update to RFC 2068 [33].
