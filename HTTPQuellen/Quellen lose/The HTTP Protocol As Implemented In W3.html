  The Original HTTP as defined in 1991
</h1>
<p>
This document defines the Hypertext Transfer protocol (HTTP) as originally
implemented by the <a name="15" href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web</a> initaitive
software in the prototype released. This is a subset of the
<a name="1" href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTTP2.html">full</a> HTTP protocol, and is known as HTTP
0.9.
</p><p>
No client profile information is transferred with the query. Future HTTP
protocols will be back-compatible with this protocol.
</p><p>
This restricted protocol is very simple and may always be used when you do
not need the capabilities of the full protocol which is backwards compatible.
</p><p>
The definition of this protocol is in the public domain (see
<a name="16" href="https://www.w3.org/Policy.html">policy</a> ).
</p><p>
The protocol uses the normal internet-style telnet protocol style on a TCP-IP
link. The following describes how a client acquires a (hypertext) document
from an HTTP server, given an HTTP document
<a name="6" href="https://www.w3.org/Addressing/HTTPAddressing.html">address</a> .
</p><h2>
  Connection
</h2>
<p>
The client makes a TCP-IP connection to the host using the
<a name="7" href="https://www.w3.org/Addressing/BNF.html#5">domain name</a> or
<a name="8" href="https://www.w3.org/Addressing/BNF.html#45">IP number</a> , and the
<a name="9" href="https://www.w3.org/Addressing/BNF.html#7">port number</a> given in the
address.
</p><p>
If the port number is not specified, 80 is always assumed for HTTP.
</p><p>
The server accepts the connection.
</p><p>
Note: HTTP currently runs over TCP, but could run over any connection-oriented
service. The interpretation of the protocol below in the case of a sequenced
packet service (such as DECnet(TM) or ISO TP4) is that that the request should
be one TPDU, but the response may be many.
</p><h2>
  Request
</h2>
<p>
The client sends a document request consisting of a line of ASCII characters
terminated by a CR LF (carriage return, line feed) pair. A well-behaved server
will not require the carriage return character.
</p><p>
This request consists of the word "GET", a space, the
<a name="10" href="https://www.w3.org/Addressing/BNF.html#1">document address</a> , omitting
the "http:, host and port parts when they are the coordinates just used to
make the connection. (If a gateway is being used, then a full document address
may be given specifying a different naming scheme).
</p><p>
The document address will consist of a single word (ie no spaces). If any
further words are found on the request line, they MUST either be ignored,
or else treated according to the <a name="z17" href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTTP2.html">full HTTP
spec</a> .
</p><p>
The search functionality of the protocol lies in the ability of the addressing
syntax to describe a <a name="14" href="https://www.w3.org/Addressing/Search.html">search
on a named index</a> .
</p><p>
A search should only be requested by a client when the index document itself
has been descibed as an index using the
<a name="12" href="https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Tags.html#18">ISINDEX tag</a> .
</p><h2>
  Response
</h2>
<p>
The response to a simple GET request is a message in hypertext mark-up language
(<a name="11" href="https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/"> HTML</a> ). This is a byte stream of
ASCII characters.
</p><p>
Lines shall be delimited by an optional carriage return followed by a mandatory
line feed chararcter. The client should not assume that the carriage return
will be present. Lines may be of any length. Well-behaved servers should
retrict line length to 80 characters excluding the CR LF pair.
</p><p>
The format of the message is HTML - that is, a trimmed SGML document. Note
that this format allows for menus and hit lists to be returned as hypertext.
It also allows for plain ASCII text to be returned following the PLAINTEXT
tag .
</p><p>
The message is terminated by the closing of the connection by the server.
</p><p>
Well-behaved clients will read the entire document as fast as possible. The
client shall not wait for user action (output paging for example) before
reading the whole of the document. The server may impose a timeout of the
order of 15 seconds on inactivity.
</p><p>
Error responses are supplied in human readable text in HTML syntax. There
is no way to distinguish an error response from a satisfactory response except
for the content of the text.
</p><h2>
  Disconnection
</h2>
<p>
The TCP-IP connection is broken by the server when the whole document has
been transferred.
</p><p>
The client may abort the transfer by breaking the connection before this,
in which case the server shall not record any error condition.
</p><p>
Requests are <a name="2" href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP.html#13">idempotent</a> . The server
need not store any information about the request after disconnection.
